# Syömään! 

## General info

This website has been planned and created as a school project in the spring semester 2022 
(Lapland University of Applied Sciences, Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology,
second year). I have realized the entire project by myself. I needed something for my own needs (planning a shopping list for an entire week), 
so I decided to dedicate this project for covering that need. 
The goal of the project was to further develop programming skills, practice project planning and create
a functional entirety from scratch. Please note the UI is in Finnish. 

## Technologies

- Python
- MongoDB
- HTML, Jinja2 templates, JS and CSS

## Features

#### Unregistered users can:
  - See the recipes on the front page
  - Filter the recipes by pre-defined categories 
#### Registered users can, in addition to the above:
  - Create recipes 
  - Delete and modify their own recipes
  - Add recipes to a printable weekly plan which also includes an auto-generated shopping list 
  
## Next features to be developed - just for practice:
- Possibility to choose a day from a calendar for the weekly plan, give the plan a name and save it (right now it's just empty text fields where the user can write a day, but this cannot be saved)
- Adding a profile picture
- Further development of measurement conversions
- Possibility to share a recipe e.g. in social media or to send it to someone by e-mail
- Resetting a forgotten password

#### The name "Syömään!" is Finnish and could be roughly translated for example to "The dinner is ready!".

# Syömään! What is this project about?

This website has been planned and created as a school project in the spring semester 2022 
(Lapland University of Applied Sciences, Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology,
second year). I have realized the entire project by myself. The goal of the project
was to further develop programming skills (Python as backend language, MongoDB as database), learn project planning and create
something from scratch. The pages (frontend) are in Finnish.

I needed something for my own needs - planning a shopping list for entire week, 
so I decided to dedicate this project for covering that need. As a result, I have 
a website with the following features:
- Unregistered users can:
  - See the recipes on the front page
  - Filter the recipes by pre-defined categories
- Registered users can, in addition to the above:
  - Create recipes 
  - Delete and modify their own recipes
  - Add recipes to a printable weekly plan which also includes an auto-generated shopping list 

The website is still just a stub though, running on localhost...
Next features to be developed - just for practice:
- Possibility to choose a day from a calendar for the weekly plan, give the plan a name and save it (right now it's just empty text fields where the user can write a day, but this cannot be saved)
- Adding a profile picture
- Further development of measurement conversions
- Possibility to share a recipe e.g. in social media or to send it to someone by e-mail
- Resetting a forgotten password

The name "Syömään!" is Finnish and could be roughly translated for example to "The dinner is ready!".
